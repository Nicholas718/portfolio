<h3> About me </h3>
</section>
<p>I'm Nicholas, and I'm passionate about computers, gaming, anime, and cars. Computers intrigue me, from building custom rigs to exploring their inner workings. 
    Gaming offers immersive experiences, and I enjoy exploring various genres. 
    Anime's vibrant stories and characters captivate me. My favorite car is the Porsche 992 GT3, known for its stunning design and high-performance capabilities. 
    These interests define me and provide endless opportunities for enjoyment and personal growth.</p>
